Why I picked each image

Amsa Uniform - I picked this image because the project we are doing will eventually require the detection of logos, and starting with our own school is a good start. It will also be used to do clothing detection, and has the ability to be used for face detection along with person detection.

Work Uniform - This image has better resolution which is why this was picked along with the Amsa uniform, to test if the difference in quality will have different results. It can use person detection, clothing detection, face detection, and logo detection.

Variety of Uniforms - The reason I picked this image along with the other two uniforms pictures is because the variety of the clothing. I wanted to see how the Ai would react to all of these different outfits. It would use person, clothing, and face detection.

Image from a sky view - This image is an important one to test with because you can see glimpses of peoples faces and clothing, but it may be hard to see. This image would use clothing, face, and person detection.

Image from the side - I selected this image because of the angle at which the picture was taken, and the skin color of this person. Trying to see if the Ai could have some bias from the skin color, or not be able to detect the face or clothing because of the given angle. The only detection methods that we may be able to use on this one is clothing, face, and person detection.

People who painted their body - I thought that all of the paint on their bodys may affect how the Ai would detect them, whether it even detects a person at all or the face, and clothing. The types of detection methods that would be attempted to use would be face, person, and clothing (despite wearing barely any clothing).

Mascot with people - This image is more standard then all of the other ones, besides the mascot in the middle. There may be some sort of mistake on attempting to detect the mascot because it is cluttered in with people, which is why it is a good thing to test. The person, clothing, and face detection methods are the only types that would be used in this scenario.

The back of people from a distant view - Quality and size of the image are both pretty poor, and is taken from behind them which is a good reason to test if person detection would work, because all you can see if their backs. The types of detection methods that would be used are person, and clothing detection.

Picture of peoples backs with poor resolution - This image does not have the best quality and can barely see some of the people, so this would be a great way to test person detection, to see if it can detect people without most of their body. Face, Clothing, and person detection can all be used for this image.

Largest selfie ever - This image is very unique because it is very different in certain sections. At one parts all you can see is faces, and others full bodys, so this would be a great way to person detection, and face detection. The types of detection that would be used is face, clothing, and person detection.

The back of someone wearing fancy clothes - Like the largest selfie ever image there are multiple different sections to this image, and can be tested in different ways. Some parts you can barely see people and their faces, but the main part of the image has some different types of clothing, along with the fact they are not facing you. So the types of detection methods that can be used are person, clothing, and an attempt in face detection.
